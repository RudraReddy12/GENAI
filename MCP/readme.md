#  CryptoMind — MCP Crypto Chatbot

A focused MCP chatbot using **Gemini** as the LLM and **CoinGecko** for live crypto prices and coin comparisons using MCP.
No keyword matching. No rule-based routing. Gemini decides when to call the tool.

---
## Problem Statement : 
Crypto users require fast, accurate, and real-time price insights along with meaningful comparisons between cryptocurrencies in a conversational interface. However, existing chatbot solutions often hallucinate information, rely on outdated data, or lack seamless integration with real-time crypto APIs, resulting in unreliable and inconsistent user experiences.

## Business objective:
The primary business objective is to build a crypto chatbot that can answers to user quries regarding the crypto currencies based on the real time data

##  MCP Flow

```
User: "What's the price of Bitcoin?"
  ↓
Gemini receives query + tool schema
  ↓
Gemini decides → call get_crypto_price(coin="bitcoin")
  ↓
CoinGecko API → { price: $65000, change: +2.3% }
  ↓
Result sent back to Gemini
  ↓
Gemini formats: "Bitcoin is trading at $65,000 📈 (+2.3% today)"
  ↓
User sees clean, natural response
```
